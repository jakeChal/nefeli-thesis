   abstract = {Decision-making for engineering systems management can be efficiently formulated using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). Typical MDP/POMDP solution procedures utilize offline knowledge about the environment and provide detailed policies for relatively small systems with tractable state and action spaces. However, in large multi-component systems the dimensions of these spaces easily explode, as system states and actions scale exponentially with the number of components, whereas environment dynamics are difficult to be described explicitly for the entire system and may, often, only be accessible through computationally expensive numerical simulators. In this work, to address these issues, an integrated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework is introduced. The Deep Centralized Multi-agent Actor Critic (DCMAC) is developed, an off-policy actor-critic DRL algorithm that directly probes the state/belief space of the underlying MDP/POMDP, providing efficient life-cycle policies for large multi-component systems operating in high-dimensional spaces. Apart from deep network approximators parametrizing complex functions with vast state spaces, DCMAC also adopts a factorized representation of the system actions, thus being able to designate individualized component- and subsystem-level decisions, while maintaining a centralized value function for the entire system. DCMAC compares well against Deep Q-Network and exact solutions, where applicable, and outperforms optimized baseline policies that are based, on time-based, condition-based, and periodic inspection and maintenance considerations.},

   abstract = {The 2018 revision of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) sets a clear direction for the full decarboni-sation of the European building stock by 2050, and calls for policies and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation of buildings. While one-step renovations have the advantage of integral planning and construction work without component connections and lock-in problems, staged renovations allow for less disruptive and more cost-efficient renovation measures by aligning them with given 'trigger points'. These are occasions either prompted by practical opportunities (e.g. need for repairs or building an extension), personal circumstances (e.g. a newborn in the family, retiring or children moving out), or change of ownership. Staged renovations are by far the most common across Eu-rope (e.g. 85 % of renovations in Germany). This paper analyses how well-planned staged renovations can lead to a highly efficient building based on model calculations for typical German residential building. The model calculation shows that while the one-step renovation leads to 20 % higher energy savings over time for a 1990s multi-family building, the total cost is around 6 % lower in the stepwise renovation due to coupling the renovation measures to the maintenance and repair work required. The paper concludes that one-step and staged renovations are not in competition with each other, but are both suitable solutions depending on the specific situation. It is crucial, however , that appropriate (national) renovation strategies ensure that staged renovations are deep. For this purpose, the paper draws on material compiled in the European Horizon2020 funded iBRoad project, which focuses on the development, testing and implementation of the building renovation passport (BRP). The BRP has been presented on the 2011 eceee summer study and since then been developed, implemented in several countries and referenced by the revised EPBD. The paper will describe the implementation options and experience gained so far.},

   abstract = {The EPBD 2018/844/EU introduced new instruments: the national long-term strategies and the building renovation passports. One aspect of the building renovation passports is the step-by-step renovation roadmap, a long-term plan that mainly indicates the building's stepwise energy performance decrease. Other non-energy related indicators as investment costs and co-benefits (thermal comfort and indoor air quality) are also included. This paper aims to analyze the individual building roadmaps developed during the EU-funded iBRoad project. Furthermore, to verify their compliance with the national long-term renovation strategies (LTRS). Because many countries still do not have submitted their LTRS yet, the present paper proposes seven indicators to assess the roadmaps. However, none of the buildings fulfilled all indicators. 4 buildings in Portugal and 1 in Bulgaria complained more than 80% of the requirements. The results show that there is still a need for financing schemes and policy design that considers the step-by-step approach's singularities. Key Innovations • Energy demand calculation and the step-by-step renovation approach • Step-by-step individual buildings roadmaps tools • The link between building retrofitting activities and building stock decarbonization Practical Implications This paper aims to contribute to the acceleration of renovation activities in the European building stock. This goal can be achieved by improving policy and financing design schemes closer to real-life renovation practices.},

   abstract = {Systems and machines undergo various failure modes that result in machine health degradation, so maintenance actions are required to restore them back to a state where they can perform their expected functions. Since maintenance tasks are inevitable, maintenance planning is essential to ensure the smooth operations of the production system and other industries at large. Maintenance planning is a decision-making problem that aims at developing optimum maintenance policies and plans that help reduces maintenance costs, extend asset life, maximize their availability, and ultimately ensure workplace safety. Reinforcement learning is a data-driven decision-making algorithm that has been increasingly applied to develop dynamic maintenance plans while leveraging the continuous information from condition monitoring of the system and machine states. By leveraging the condition monitoring data of systems and machines with reinforcement learning, smart maintenance planners can be developed, which is a precursor to achieving a smart factory. This paper presents a literature review on the applications of reinforcement and deep reinforcement learning for maintenance planning and optimization problems. To capture the common ideas without losing touch with the uniqueness of each publication, taxonomies used to categorize the systems were developed, and reviewed publications were highlighted, classified, and summarized based on these taxonomies. Adopted methodologies, findings, and well-defined interpretations of the reviewed studies were summarized in graphical and tabular representations to maximize the utility of the work for both researchers and practitioners. This work also highlights the research gaps, key insights from the literature, and areas for future work.},

   abstract = {Since 2002, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) has set up the path to improve the efficiency gains in the EU building sector, including measures that should accelerate the rate of building renovation towards more energy efficient systems. Under the 2010 EPBD, all EU countries have established independent energy performance certification systems supported by independent mechanisms of control and verification. The EU directive 2018/844 has introduced different novelties and one of these regards the possibility for the Member States, together with the Long-Term Renovation Strategies (LTRS), to introduce an optional Building Renovation Passport Article 2a.1(c), considered as an empowering document that gives more reliable and independent information on the potential for energy savings that is tied up in their buildings. On 14 October 2020, the European Commission launched its Communication and Strategy on the Renovation Wave initiative, intending to double the current Europe’s renovation rate to make the continent carbon neutral by 2050. However, current practices and tools of energy performance assessment and certification applied across Europe face several challenges. In this context, the ALDREN project is a methodological framework that aims to support decision-making and investment in deep energy renovation of nonresidential buildings, based on a set of procedures (modules) that consist in the step-by-step implementation of protocols to assess the energy performance, indoor environmental quality, and financial value of buildings, before and after the energy renovation. The paper presents the ALDREN overall procedure with a focus on the development of the Building Renovation Passport and its application to an Italian office building.},
