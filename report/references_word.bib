   abstract = {Decision-making for engineering systems management can be efficiently formulated using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). Typical MDP/POMDP solution procedures utilize offline knowledge about the environment and provide detailed policies for relatively small systems with tractable state and action spaces. However, in large multi-component systems the dimensions of these spaces easily explode, as system states and actions scale exponentially with the number of components, whereas environment dynamics are difficult to be described explicitly for the entire system and may, often, only be accessible through computationally expensive numerical simulators. In this work, to address these issues, an integrated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework is introduced. The Deep Centralized Multi-agent Actor Critic (DCMAC) is developed, an off-policy actor-critic DRL algorithm that directly probes the state/belief space of the underlying MDP/POMDP, providing efficient life-cycle policies for large multi-component systems operating in high-dimensional spaces. Apart from deep network approximators parametrizing complex functions with vast state spaces, DCMAC also adopts a factorized representation of the system actions, thus being able to designate individualized component- and subsystem-level decisions, while maintaining a centralized value function for the entire system. DCMAC compares well against Deep Q-Network and exact solutions, where applicable, and outperforms optimized baseline policies that are based, on time-based, condition-based, and periodic inspection and maintenance considerations.},

   abstract = {The 2018 revision of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) sets a clear direction for the full decarboni-sation of the European building stock by 2050, and calls for policies and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation of buildings. While one-step renovations have the advantage of integral planning and construction work without component connections and lock-in problems, staged renovations allow for less disruptive and more cost-efficient renovation measures by aligning them with given 'trigger points'. These are occasions either prompted by practical opportunities (e.g. need for repairs or building an extension), personal circumstances (e.g. a newborn in the family, retiring or children moving out), or change of ownership. Staged renovations are by far the most common across Eu-rope (e.g. 85 % of renovations in Germany). This paper analyses how well-planned staged renovations can lead to a highly efficient building based on model calculations for typical German residential building. The model calculation shows that while the one-step renovation leads to 20 % higher energy savings over time for a 1990s multi-family building, the total cost is around 6 % lower in the stepwise renovation due to coupling the renovation measures to the maintenance and repair work required. The paper concludes that one-step and staged renovations are not in competition with each other, but are both suitable solutions depending on the specific situation. It is crucial, however , that appropriate (national) renovation strategies ensure that staged renovations are deep. For this purpose, the paper draws on material compiled in the European Horizon2020 funded iBRoad project, which focuses on the development, testing and implementation of the building renovation passport (BRP). The BRP has been presented on the 2011 eceee summer study and since then been developed, implemented in several countries and referenced by the revised EPBD. The paper will describe the implementation options and experience gained so far.},

Energies 2021, 14, 6929. Abstract: Office buildings built before the pre-1960 age constitute a relevant group for analyzing the energy performance of the Portuguese building sector. A dynamic energy simulation was used to assess the energy performance of an existing office building located in the town of Bragança, Portugal. By using a staged renovation approach, two passive technologies applied to the building envelope and an efficient domestic hot water system were selected and a financial evaluation through the net saving (NS) method was undertaken to choose the best efficiency measures/packages for improving the building's energy performance. Real discount rates of 3% and 1% were used in the financial evaluation. Considering the real discount rate of 3%, the results showed that only two out seven retrofit options had a positive financial return. By using the real discount rate of 1%, all retrofit options were found to be financially efficient. The results of the study corroborated those of earlier works that found that the financial profitability of energy renovation investments is very sensitive to the discount rate used in the analysis. The results of the study also suggested that the staged renovation approach used in the analysis is economically feasible, and that this approach is an alternative to one-step renovation approach to help to achieve the countrys energy and climate targets by 2030. Suggestions for future research conducted for office buildings in the different climate zones and other age groups in Portugal are proposed.},

   abstract = {Since 2002, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) has set up the path to improve the efficiency gains in the EU building sector, including measures that should accelerate the rate of building renovation towards more energy efficient systems. Under the 2010 EPBD, all EU countries have established independent energy performance certification systems supported by independent mechanisms of control and verification. The EU directive 2018/844 has introduced different novelties and one of these regards the possibility for the Member States, together with the Long-Term Renovation Strategies (LTRS), to introduce an optional Building Renovation Passport Article 2a.1(c), considered as an empowering document that gives more reliable and independent information on the potential for energy savings that is tied up in their buildings. On 14 October 2020, the European Commission launched its Communication and Strategy on the Renovation Wave initiative, intending to double the current Europe’s renovation rate to make the continent carbon neutral by 2050. However, current practices and tools of energy performance assessment and certification applied across Europe face several challenges. In this context, the ALDREN project is a methodological framework that aims to support decision-making and investment in deep energy renovation of nonresidential buildings, based on a set of procedures (modules) that consist in the step-by-step implementation of protocols to assess the energy performance, indoor environmental quality, and financial value of buildings, before and after the energy renovation. The paper presents the ALDREN overall procedure with a focus on the development of the Building Renovation Passport and its application to an Italian office building.},

   abstract = {A novel methodology for calculating optimized refurbishment roadmaps is developed in this paper. The aim of the roadmaps is to determine when and how should which component of the building envelope and heat generation system be refurbished to achieve the lowest net present value. The integrated optimization approach couples a particle swarm optimization algorithm with a dynamic building simulation of the building envelope and the heat supply system. Due to a free selection of implementation times and refurbishment depth, the optimization method achieves the lowest net present value and high CO 2 reduction and is therefore an important contribution to achieve climate neutrality in the building stock. The method is exemplarily applied to a multi-family house built in 1970. In comparison to a standard refurbishment roadmap, cost savings of 6-16 % and CO 2 savings of 6-59 % are possible. The sensitivity of the refurbishment roadmap measures is analyzed on the basis of a parametric analysis. Robust optimization results are obtained with a mean refurbishment level of approx. 50 kWh/m 2 /a of the building envelope. The preferred heat generation system is a bivalent brine-heat pump system with a share of 70 % of the heat load being covered by the electric heat pump.},

Since maintenance tasks are inevitable, maintenance planning is essential to ensure the smooth operations of the production system and other industries at large. Maintenance planning is a decision-making problem that aims at developing optimum maintenance policies and plans that help reduces maintenance costs, extend asset life, maximize their availability, and ultimately ensure workplace safety. Reinforcement learning is a data-driven decision-making algorithm that has been increasingly applied to develop dynamic maintenance plans while leveraging the continuous information from condition monitoring of the system and machine states. By leveraging the condition monitoring data of systems and machines with reinforcement learning, smart maintenance planners can be developed, which is a precursor to achieving a smart factory. This paper presents a literature review on the applications of reinforcement and deep reinforcement learning for maintenance planning and optimization problems. To capture the common ideas without losing touch with the uniqueness of each publication, taxonomies used to categorize the systems were developed, and reviewed publications were highlighted, classified, and summarized based on these taxonomies. Adopted methodologies, findings, and well-defined interpretations of the reviewed studies were summarized in graphical and tabular representations to maximize the utility of the work for both researchers and practitioners. This work also highlights the research gaps, key insights from the literature, and areas for future work.},

In recent years, many different thermal insulation materials have been developed for better energy efficiency and less environment damage. These products have confirmed their usefulness in buildings due to their benefits such as low density, high thermal resistance, and cost effectiveness. The efficiency of thermal insulation depends on their thermal conductivity and their ability to maintain their thermal characteristics over a period of time. This study presents factors influencing the thermal conductivity coefficient of three main groups including conventional, alternative, and new advanced materials. The most common factors are moisture content, temperature difference, and bulk density. Other factors are explained in some dependent studies such as airflow velocity, thickness, pressure, and material aging. The relationship between the thermal conductivity values with the mean temperature, moisture content, and density which were obtained from experimental investigation has also been summarized. Finally, uncertainty about the thermal conductivity value of some common insulation materials is also reviewed as the basis of selecting or designing the products used in building envelopes.},

One aspect of the building renovation passports is the step-by-step renovation roadmap, a long-term plan that mainly indicates the building's stepwise energy performance decrease. Other non-energy related indicators as investment costs and co-benefits (thermal comfort and indoor air quality) are also included. This paper aims to analyze the individual building roadmaps developed during the EU-funded iBRoad project. Furthermore, to verify their compliance with the national long-term renovation strategies (LTRS). Because many countries still do not have submitted their LTRS yet, the present paper proposes seven indicators to assess the roadmaps. However, none of the buildings fulfilled all indicators. 4 buildings in Portugal and 1 in Bulgaria complained more than 80% of the requirements. The results show that there is still a need for financing schemes and policy design that considers the step-by-step approach's singularities. Key Innovations • Energy demand calculation and the step-by-step renovation approach • Step-by-step individual buildings roadmaps tools • The link between building retrofitting activities and building stock decarbonization Practical Implications This paper aims to contribute to the acceleration of renovation activities in the European building stock.

   abstract = {Insulation materials used for buildings are broadly classified as organic insulation materials or inorganic insulation materials. Foam gas is used for producing organic insulation materials. The thermal conductivity of foam gas is generally lower than that of air. As a result, foam gas is discharged over time and replaced by outside air that has relatively less thermal resistance. The gas composition ratio in air bubbles inside the insulation materials changes rapidly, causing the performance degradation of insulation materials. Such performance degradation can be classified into different stages. Stage 1 appears to have a duration of 5 years, and Stage 2 takes a period of over 10 years. In this study, two insulation materials that are most frequently used in South Korea were analyzed, focusing on the changes thermal resistance for the period of over 5000 days. The measurement result indicated that the thermal resistance of expanded polystyrene fell below the KS performance standards after about 80-150 days from its production date. After about 5000 days, its thermal resistance decreased by 25.7 % to 42.7 % in comparison with the initial thermal resistance. In the case of rigid polyurethane, a pattern of rapid performance degradation appeared about 100 days post-production, and the thermal resistance fell below the KS performance standards after about 1000 days. The thermal resistance decreased by 22.5 % to 27.4 % in comparison with the initial thermal resistance after about 5000 days.},
